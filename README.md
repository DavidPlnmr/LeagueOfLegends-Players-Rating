# Leaguepedia Client

This is a NON-OFFICIAL client for the Leaguepedia API. It is written in Python 3.11 and is currently in development.

## Installation

### From source

To install the client, run the following command:

```bash
python3 -m venv venv
source venv/bin/activate
pip install -r requirements.txt
```

Then you just have to import the client in your project:

```python
from leaguepedia_client import LeaguepediaClient
```

I'll probably upload it to PyPI when it's ready for production.
